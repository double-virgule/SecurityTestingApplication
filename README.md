## Security Test App
We were testing some security configurations on our PCs, and needed to run some tests (download a file, user-level batch scripting, etc.) 
and I was tired of just running the commands manually. To keep things simple for other testers, I just wrote this super simple program that allows
you to: 
- Download a PS script from a repository here on my Github.
- Create a file using cmd.exe
- Run the Powershell script you downloaded (or if you skipped that step, one bundled into the program)
- Dump all the above tests and results into a log file.

I'm not a programmer, and I didn't want to waste too much time on this, so it is what it is. Feel free to take it and improve it, or just laugh at it.
